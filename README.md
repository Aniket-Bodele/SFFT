# SFFT
SFFT block takes 8*8 complex inputs (in which we need to provide real and complex inputs separately), inputs need to be given in 12 bits in which last 4 bits are reserved for the numbers after decimal point , This ISFFT block is made of self made FFT And IFFT blocks given in the code below .
